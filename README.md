This is a game inspired by the Atari classic "Missile Command."



Enemy missiles fall from the sky to obliterate your people; defend them with the three laser turrets station along these cities.

The idea is to save at least one city each level from the onslaught.

You receive points after each level depending on the number of cities remaining and the number of shots you have left.

Levels become increasingly more difficult.

Your highest score will be recorded.
